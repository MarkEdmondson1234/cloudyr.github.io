### Project Packages for GCS ###

## Installation Instructions ##

As they are released, all packages are hosted in [a drat repository](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat) on this website (specifically: [http://cloudyr.github.io/drat](http://cloudyr.github.io/drat)) and versions are updated daily and are periodically released to CRAN. This means you can install and upgrade cloudyr packages quite simply directly from R:

```R
if(!require("drat")) {
    install.packages("drat")
    library("drat")
}
addRepo("cloudyr")
install.packages("NameOfPackage")
```

To make this even easier, you can add `drat::addRepo("cloudyr")` to your `.Rprofile` or `Rprofile.site` file, so that the cloudyr repository is available every time you open R.


### Installation using devtools ###

You can also install packages using `devtools::install_github()`. Note, however, that all stable versions of packages are automatically added to the cloudyr drat, so you can always retrieve a stable version using the above workflow. To obtain a potentially unstable version, use:

```R
if(!require("devtools")) {
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
}
install_github("cloudyr/NameOfPackage")
```
