Contributions are always welcome. See [the cloudyr style guide](../styleguide/index.html) for guidance on package development, structure, and coding style. Pull requests via GitHub are the preferred way to contribute code and documentation. Ideas, brainstorming, and general discussion are welcome as issues on project-specific repositories or in [cloudyr's gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/cloudyr).

## Installation Instructions ##

As they are released, all packages are hosted in [a drat repository](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat) on this website (specifically: [http://cloudyr.github.io/drat](http://cloudyr.github.io/drat)) and versions are updated daily and are periodically released to CRAN. This means you can install and upgrade cloudyr packages quite simply directly from R:

```R
if(!require("drat")) {
    install.packages("drat")
    library("drat")
}
addRepo("cloudyr")
install.packages("NameOfPackage")
```

To make this even easier, you can add `drat::addRepo("cloudyr")` to your `.Rprofile` or `Rprofile.site` file, so that the cloudyr repository is available every time you open R.


### Installation using devtools or ghit ###

You can also install packages using `devtools::install_github()` or `ghit::install_github()` (which provides a lighter weight installer). Note, however, that all stable versions of packages are automatically added to the cloudyr drat, so you can always retrieve a stable version using the above workflow. To obtain a potentially unstable version, use:

```R
ghit::install_github("cloudyr/NameOfPackage")

# or
devtools::install_github("cloudyr/NameOfPackage")
```
